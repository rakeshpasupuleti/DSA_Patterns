## 6. In-Place Reversal of Linked List

### Description
The In-Place Reversal of Linked List pattern is used to reverse a linked list, or a part of it, without using extra space. This pattern is common in problems that involve reversing the order of nodes in a linked list.

### Tips to Identify the Pattern
